# Splatter

## Fork
This fork simply adds support for systems that do not use an HP system that counts down, but instead counts up.
The original code can be found [here](https://github.com/theripper93/Splatter). If you like their work, give them a
shout out or support their patreon if you wish.

## NOTICE: FEATURE REQUESTS

I know that this implementation doesen't have all the features BnG had BUT i feel like it has enough customization for most people. Because the point of this module is to keep it streamlined to avoid making it impossible to mantain no feature requests will be implemented. Unless is something that all the users of this module would greatly benfit from, please refrain from asking. Thanks for your understanding :)

## FAQ

**Blood and guts exists, why make a new one?:** Blood and guts was a massive project and while it was amazing, with a lot of code comes a lot of issues and it's extremely difficult to mantain and fix. This implementation is simpler and more streamlined, and while it has less features, it will be much easier to mantain and adopt if it ever gets abandoned
